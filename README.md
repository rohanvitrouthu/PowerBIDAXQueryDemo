The following are the DAX functions used to build several Measures in the PowerBI dashboard:
1. SUM()
2. DIVIDE()
3. CALCULATE()
4. IF()
5. SWITCH()
6. COUNTROWS()

Some composite measures i.e. measures built using one or more existing measures were also created to demonstrate the reusability of Measures.

Majority of the visualizations are tables as the focus was on how different Measures are used in different contexts to get the desired result.

There are notes included beside the visualizations for the behavior of some functions like IF(), CALCULATE() and SWITCH().
